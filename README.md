Soundviron:

This is a capstone project that aims to take data from .midi files and translate that to coordinates, edges and faces in a 3D space, hopefully making a 3D model based on how the program interprets the data.

This project is heavily based in Blender and utilizes the Blender API, Python Scripts and external Python Midi Libraries, so you will need to install them onto your computer in order for this program to work...

More to come.
